# Lesson 5: Functions

TODO: talk about how expressions get replaced with their result

Functions take input, via parameters. The values given to the function are called arguments. Arguments go into parameters. These are subtly different, lots of people use the terms interchangeably, and it's rarely confusing.

functions return their results by the return value.

to return a value, use the return keyword.

1. write a function that returns 1.

1. write a function that returns the number you give it

1. write a function that returns twice the number you give it

1. write a function that returns half the number you give it

1. write a function that returns true if the number is even

1. write a function that returns half of any even number given, and twice any odd number given

1. write a function that prints "foo" if the number given is divisible by 3
