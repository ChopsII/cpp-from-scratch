# Design Goals

## Audience

- Targetting anyone who can use a computer, read english, has internet.

- No need to understand any jargon before starting course.

## End result for audience

- End result should be someone who can write a program in C++
  - TODO elborate

## Terms / glossary

- All terms should be able to be clicked to get further information - more information about the term itself, and links to related terms, etc

- Terms used in-situ should have enough contextual explanation for them to make sense in-situ, but the drill-down into the term will give a more complete and general description for any context

## Responsiveness to feedback

- Any time someone says that something is not as clear as they would like, or that a term is not understood and not explained, that feedback should be taken seriously and every effort should be made to meet their expectations

  - For example, if a term is assumed to be universally understood by English speakers, but someone doesn't know what it means, we should add it to the glossary
